Implement a program that prints out a half-pyramid of a specified height, per the below.

$ ./mario
Height: 4
   #

Specification
Write, in a file called mario.py in ~/pset6/mario/less/, a program that recreates the half-pyramid using hashes (#) for blocks, exactly as you did in Problem Set 1, except that your program this time should be written in Python.
To make things more interesting, first prompt the user with get_int for the half-pyramid’s height, a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive.
If the user fails to provide a positive integer no greater than 8, you should re-prompt for the same again.
Then, generate (with the help of print and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramid.
Take care to align the bottom-left corner of your half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of your terminal window.
Usage
Your program should behave per the example below.

$ ./mario
Height: 4
